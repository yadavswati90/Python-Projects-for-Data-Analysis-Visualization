# Data Analysis Projects | IBM Professional Certificate
Welcome to my <b>Data Analysis Projects</b> repository, where I showcase projects completed as part of my <b>IBM Professional Certificate in Data Science.</b> ðŸŽ“ This repository features a variety of projects that demonstrate my ability to work with <b>Python, SQL, Machine Learning models, and Data Visualization techniques</b> to extract valuable insights from data.

### Projects Overview
1. Data Science and Python Basics
Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
Description: This project focuses on learning the fundamentals of Python programming for data science. It includes data cleaning, transformation, and basic analysis using popular libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
Key Skills: Data cleaning, data exploration, working with Python data structures.
2. SQL for Data Science
Tools: SQL (SQLite, PostgreSQL)
Description: In this project, I worked with SQL to query data from relational databases. The focus was on JOINs, aggregating data, and performing complex queries to extract actionable insights.
Key Skills: Writing SQL queries, data extraction, aggregating data.
3. Data Analysis with Python
Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Description: Using Python, this project demonstrates how to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize and summarize datasets, uncover trends, and identify key insights. Visualizations include bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and more.
Key Skills: Data visualization, trend analysis, using Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting.
4. Machine Learning with Scikit-learn
Tools: Python (Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
Description: This project focuses on applying machine learning models like linear regression, classification, and clustering to make predictions or uncover hidden patterns in data. It includes steps for feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
Key Skills: Supervised learning, model evaluation, feature engineering, using Scikit-learn.
5. Data Visualization: Storytelling with Graphs
Tools: Python (Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Description: Data visualization plays a key role in helping tell compelling stories. This project focuses on creating interactive and static visualizations, including bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts, to showcase trends and patterns.
Key Skills: Data visualization, storytelling with data, using Plotly and Seaborn.


### Key Features of the Projects
